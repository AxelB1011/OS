# OS
- Projects made for my Operating Systems class. 
- Assignment 1 is mostly about forking. 
- Project 3 is the implementation of the third reader writer problem where neither the writer nor the readers starve. 
- Project 4 is about implementing stat, ls(including ls -l [directory]), tail, and recursive search (all terminal commands) using C.
